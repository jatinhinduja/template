Structure (For developers):

    - Database:
      The database is hosted on three serverless DynamoDB tables:
        - rooms : This table contains the prices, room numbers and categories of rooms.
        - availability : A calendar table that shows the availability of each room for the next month.
        - temp : A table with only one record at a time, the bill details of the customer.

    - Front-end:
        - index.html : The home page that shows details of the rooms.
        - booking.html : The booking page with the form.
        - booking_details.html : The details of the bill should be visible on this page.
        - show_room_details.html : The HTML page for the admin that shows the availability table.

    - APIs:
        - https://p4bkuyvb1h.execute-api.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/dev/home [GET]
          This GET API fetches the date from the table "rooms" and returns it to index.html.
